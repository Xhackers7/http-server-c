    <p><h3>We're no strangers to love
        You know the rules and so do I (do I)
        A full commitment's what I'm thinking of
        You wouldn't get this from any other guy</h3></p>
        <p><h3>I just wanna tell you how I'm feeling
        Gotta make you understand</h3></p>
       <p><h3> Never gonna give you up
        Never gonna let you down

        Never gonna tell a lie and hurt you</h3></p>
        <p><h3>We've known each other for so long
        Your heart's been aching, but you're too shy to say it (say it)
        Inside, we both know what's been going on (going on)
        We know the game and we're gonna play it</h3></p>
        <p><h3>And if you ask me how I'm feeling
        Don't tell me you're too blind to see</h3></p>
